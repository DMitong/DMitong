### Hi there 👋

I'm Mitong, a Lawyer💼 and a Blockchain Developer🕸️.

As a lawyer, my core areas of expertise are technology, commercial, corporate and regulatory law practice. I am passionate about the infusion of law and policy with technology to improve human personal and commercial relations, develop states, and improve government processes.

As a developer, I am enthusiastic about blockchain technology and its immense potential, the blockchain can help revolutionise how we interact on the web and with other technologies and I want to contribute to building that revolution.

I love learning and exploring new technologies, and I am always looking out for opportunities for self-improvement. Currently, I am learning the Rust lang as well as Zero Knowledge (zk) rollups.
